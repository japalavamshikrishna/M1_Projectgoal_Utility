# Introduction
Covid-19 vaccinations in India happened in a flash, making tracking extremely difficult. Several slow running issues and crashes occurred as a result of the server's multiple input and output commands. To allot the vaccines, the Aadhar details were used, so it was run on a central server. To avoid using a central server for all commands, the vaccine-registered data will be placed onto a local server. Local vaccination data verification and completion will be done locally and loaded back to the main server before the end of the day.

Where the assigned online registration data will be placed onto the local server of that local centre, the local server must retain the data of roughly 100 persons. The data is verified using the information provided by the patient. The data of the immunised will be transmitted back to be used and referenced in the future.

# Advantages
. Smoother data handling.

. Data readily available for verification.

# Disadvantages

.Encryption is not enabled to protect the data

.OTP verification is not activated for new registrations.

# SWOT Analysis

.Tracking to deploy the pace of vaccine

.Recorded data is sent to main central database

.Local vaccine centre data base enabling Smoother operations

# High Level Requirements
.Here it is implemented that user to be able to add new registerations

.It has Implemented that System should recognize Vaccinated Patients

.System should Recognize the invalid Credentials

#Low Level Requirements

# Result
